              The privacy policy is one of the most essential legal
              requirements for websites. Even if you just have a small
              business or a blog with no income at all, you might be surprised
              to discover that you still need a privacy policy. Basically, if
              your website collects personal data, you need a privacy policy
              that informs your users about this according to privacy laws in
              most jurisdictions, including the EU and the US. Almost all
              modern websites function with the use of cookies, so chances are
              high that your website is collecting personal data, for example
              for statistical, functional or marketing purposes. In this
              blogpost, we take a look at what constitutes a good privacy
              policy, how to make a compliant GDPR privacy policy and whether
              using a privacy policy generator is a good idea. Learn what the
              privacy policy is and how to get one for your website below.

            <h4 class="text-info">What is Privacy policy</h4>
            <p class="lead">
              A privacy policy is a document that states what personal data
              you collect from your users, why, and how you keep it private.
              The purpose of the privacy policy is to inform your users about
              how their data is being handled. Hence, the privacy policy
              should be accessible for your users and kept in a plain and
              readable language. Most countries have privacy laws requiring
              that websites collecting personal data have a proper privacy
              policy in place. Failure to comply can result in heavy fines and
              even prosecution. Are you based in the EU or providing services
              to EU citizens, you must have a GDPR compliant privacy policy on
              your domain. We will get into this in more detail below.
